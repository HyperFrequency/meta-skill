# Tables, Figures, and Common Issues

Presentation guidance and troubleshooting. The SKILL.md router points here.

## Tables

Use `booktabs` LaTeX package for professional tables:

```latex
\usepackage{booktabs}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Method & Accuracy ↑ & Latency ↓ \\
\midrule
Baseline & 85.2 & 45ms \\
\textbf{Ours} & \textbf{92.1} & 38ms \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
```

**Rules:**
- Bold best value per metric
- Include direction symbols (↑ higher is better, ↓ lower is better)
- Right-align numerical columns
- Consistent decimal precision

## Figures

- **Vector graphics** (PDF, EPS) for all plots and diagrams
- **Raster** (PNG 600 DPI) only for photographs
- Use **colorblind-safe palettes** (Okabe-Ito or Paul Tol)
- Verify **grayscale readability** (8% of men have color vision deficiency)
- **No title inside figure**—the caption serves this function
- **Self-contained captions**—reader should understand without main text

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Abstract too generic**

Delete first sentence if it could be prepended to any ML paper. Start with your specific
contribution.

**Issue: Introduction exceeds 1.5 pages**

Split background into Related Work. Front-load contribution bullets. Methods should start
by page 2-3.

**Issue: Experiments lack explicit claims**

Add sentence before each experiment: "This experiment tests whether [specific claim]..."

**Issue: Reviewers find paper hard to follow**

- Add explicit signposting: "In this section, we show X"
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include figure captions that stand alone

**Issue: Missing statistical significance**

Always include:
- Error bars (specify: std dev or std error)
- Number of runs
- Statistical tests if comparing methods
