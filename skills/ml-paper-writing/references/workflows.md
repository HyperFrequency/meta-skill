# Paper-Writing Workflows

Detailed, step-by-step workflows for ML/AI paper writing. The SKILL.md router points
here for the full procedures.

## Core Philosophy: Collaborative Writing

**Paper writing is collaborative, but Claude should be proactive in delivering drafts.**

The typical workflow starts with a research repository containing code, results, and
experimental artifacts. Claude's role is to:

1. **Understand the project** by exploring the repo, results, and existing documentation
2. **Deliver a complete first draft** when confident about the contribution
3. **Search literature** using web search and APIs to find relevant citations
4. **Refine through feedback cycles** when the scientist provides input
5. **Ask for clarification** only when genuinely uncertain about key decisions

**Key Principle**: Be proactive. If the repo and results are clear, deliver a full draft.
Don't block waiting for feedback on every section—scientists are busy. Produce something
concrete they can react to, then iterate based on their response.

First drafts are starting points for discussion, not final outputs.

## Workflow 0: Starting from a Research Repository

When beginning paper writing, start by understanding the project:

```
Project Understanding:
- [ ] Step 1: Explore the repository structure
- [ ] Step 2: Read README, existing docs, and key results
- [ ] Step 3: Identify the main contribution with the scientist
- [ ] Step 4: Find papers already cited in the codebase
- [ ] Step 5: Search for additional relevant literature
- [ ] Step 6: Outline the paper structure together
- [ ] Step 7: Draft sections iteratively with feedback
```

**Step 1: Explore the Repository**

```bash
# Understand project structure
ls -la
find . -name "*.py" | head -20
find . -name "*.md" -o -name "*.txt" | xargs grep -l -i "result\|conclusion\|finding"
```

Look for:
- `README.md` - Project overview and claims
- `results/`, `outputs/`, `experiments/` - Key findings
- `configs/` - Experimental settings
- Existing `.bib` files or citation references
- Any draft documents or notes

**Step 2: Identify Existing Citations**

```bash
# Find existing citations
grep -r "arxiv\|doi\|cite" --include="*.md" --include="*.bib" --include="*.py"
find . -name "*.bib"
```

These are high-signal starting points for Related Work—the scientist has already deemed
them relevant.

**Step 3: Clarify the Contribution**

Before writing, explicitly confirm with the scientist:

> "Based on my understanding of the repo, the main contribution appears to be [X].
> The key results show [Y]. Is this the framing you want for the paper,
> or should we emphasize different aspects?"

**Never assume the narrative—always verify with the human.**

**Step 4: Search for Additional Literature**

```
Search queries to try:
- "[main technique] + [application domain]"
- "[baseline method] comparison"
- "[problem name] state-of-the-art"
- Author names from existing citations
```

Then verify and retrieve BibTeX using the citation workflow (see citation-workflow.md).

**Step 5: Deliver a First Draft**

If the repo provides clear results and the contribution is apparent:
1. Write the full first draft end-to-end
2. Present the complete draft for feedback
3. Iterate based on scientist's response

If genuinely uncertain about framing or major claims:
1. Draft what you can confidently
2. Flag specific uncertainties: "I framed X as the main contribution—let me know if you'd
   prefer to emphasize Y instead"
3. Continue with the draft rather than blocking

**Questions to include with the draft** (not before):
- "I emphasized X as the main contribution—adjust if needed"
- "I highlighted results A, B, C—let me know if others are more important"
- "Related work section includes [papers]—add any I missed"

## Balancing Proactivity and Collaboration

**Default: Be proactive. Deliver drafts, then iterate.**

| Confidence Level | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| **High** (clear repo, obvious contribution) | Write full draft, deliver, iterate on feedback |
| **Medium** (some ambiguity) | Write draft with flagged uncertainties, continue |
| **Low** (major unknowns) | Ask 1-2 targeted questions, then draft |

**Draft first, ask with the draft** (not before):

| Section | Draft Autonomously | Flag With Draft |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Abstract | Yes | "Framed contribution as X—adjust if needed" |
| Introduction | Yes | "Emphasized problem Y—correct if wrong" |
| Methods | Yes | "Included details A, B, C—add missing pieces" |
| Experiments | Yes | "Highlighted results 1, 2, 3—reorder if needed" |
| Related Work | Yes | "Cited papers X, Y, Z—add any I missed" |

**Only block for input when:**
- Target venue is unclear (affects page limits, framing)
- Multiple contradictory framings seem equally valid
- Results seem incomplete or inconsistent
- Explicit request to review before continuing

**Don't block for:**
- Word choice decisions
- Section ordering
- Which specific results to show (make a choice, flag it)
- Citation completeness (draft with what you find, note gaps)

## Workflow 1: Writing a Complete Paper (Iterative)

Copy this checklist and track progress. **Each step involves drafting → feedback → revision:**

```
Paper Writing Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Define the one-sentence contribution (with scientist)
- [ ] Step 2: Draft Figure 1 → get feedback → revise
- [ ] Step 3: Draft abstract → get feedback → revise
- [ ] Step 4: Draft introduction → get feedback → revise
- [ ] Step 5: Draft methods → get feedback → revise
- [ ] Step 6: Draft experiments → get feedback → revise
- [ ] Step 7: Draft related work → get feedback → revise
- [ ] Step 8: Draft limitations → get feedback → revise
- [ ] Step 9: Complete paper checklist (required)
- [ ] Step 10: Final review cycle and submission
```

**Step 1: Define the One-Sentence Contribution**

**This step requires explicit confirmation from the scientist.**

Before writing anything, articulate and verify:
- What is the single thing your paper contributes?
- What was not obvious or present before your work?

> "I propose framing the contribution as: '[one sentence]'. Does this capture
> what you see as the main takeaway? Should we adjust the emphasis?"

**Step 2: Draft Figure 1**

Figure 1 deserves special attention—many readers skip directly to it.
- Convey core idea, approach, or most compelling result
- Use vector graphics (PDF/EPS for plots)
- Write captions that stand alone without main text
- Ensure readability in black-and-white (8% of men have color vision deficiency)

**Step 3: Write Abstract (5-Sentence Formula)**

From Sebastian Farquhar (DeepMind):

```
1. What you achieved: "We introduce...", "We prove...", "We demonstrate..."
2. Why this is hard and important
3. How you do it (with specialist keywords for discoverability)
4. What evidence you have
5. Your most remarkable number/result
```

**Delete** generic openings like "Large language models have achieved remarkable success..."

**Step 4: Write Introduction (1-1.5 pages max)**

Must include:
- 2-4 bullet contribution list (max 1-2 lines each in two-column format)
- Clear problem statement
- Brief approach overview
- Methods should start by page 2-3 maximum

**Step 5: Methods Section**

Enable reimplementation:
- Conceptual outline or pseudocode
- All hyperparameters listed
- Architectural details sufficient for reproduction
- Present final design decisions; ablations go in experiments

**Step 6: Experiments Section**

For each experiment, explicitly state:
- What claim it supports
- How it connects to main contribution
- Experimental setting (details in appendix)
- What to observe: "the blue line shows X, which demonstrates Y"

Requirements:
- Error bars with methodology (standard deviation vs standard error)
- Hyperparameter search ranges
- Compute infrastructure (GPU type, total hours)
- Seed-setting methods

**Step 7: Related Work**

Organize methodologically, not paper-by-paper:

**Good:** "One line of work uses Floogledoodle's assumption [refs] whereas we use
Doobersnoddle's assumption because..."

**Bad:** "Snap et al. introduced X while Crackle et al. introduced Y."

Cite generously—reviewers likely authored relevant papers.

**Step 8: Limitations Section (REQUIRED)**

All major conferences require this. Counter-intuitively, honesty helps:
- Reviewers are instructed not to penalize honest limitation acknowledgment
- Pre-empt criticisms by identifying weaknesses first
- Explain why limitations don't undermine core claims

**Step 9: Paper Checklist**

NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR all require paper checklists. See checklists.md.

## Workflow 3: Converting Between Conference Formats

When a paper is rejected or withdrawn from one venue and resubmitted to another, format
conversion is required. This is a common workflow in ML research.

```
Format Conversion Checklist:
- [ ] Step 1: Identify source and target template differences
- [ ] Step 2: Create new project with target template
- [ ] Step 3: Copy content sections (not preamble)
- [ ] Step 4: Adjust page limits and content
- [ ] Step 5: Update conference-specific requirements
- [ ] Step 6: Verify compilation and formatting
```

**Step 1: Key Template Differences (ML/AI Conversions)**

| From → To | Page Change | Key Adjustments |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| NeurIPS → ICML | 9 → 8 pages | Cut 1 page, add Broader Impact if missing |
| ICML → ICLR | 8 → 9 pages | Can expand experiments, add LLM disclosure |
| NeurIPS → ACL | 9 → 8 pages | Restructure for NLP conventions, add Limitations |
| ICLR → AAAI | 9 → 7 pages | Significant cuts needed, strict style adherence |
| Any → COLM | varies → 9 | Reframe for language model focus |

**ML → Systems Conversion**: When converting to OSDI, NSDI, ASPLOS, or SOSP, see the
[systems-paper-writing](../../systems-paper-writing/) skill for format conversion guidance,
templates, and structural differences.

**Step 2: Content Migration (NOT Template Merge)**

**Never copy LaTeX preambles between templates.** Instead:

```bash
# 1. Start fresh with target template
cp -r templates/icml2026/ new_submission/

# 2. Copy ONLY content sections from old paper
# - Abstract text
# - Section content (between \section{} commands)
# - Figures and tables
# - Bibliography entries

# 3. Paste into target template structure
```

**Step 3: Adjusting for Page Limits**

When cutting pages (e.g., NeurIPS 9 → AAAI 7):
- Move detailed proofs to appendix
- Condense related work (cite surveys instead of individual papers)
- Combine similar experiments into unified tables
- Use smaller figure sizes with subfigures
- Tighten writing: eliminate redundancy, use active voice

When expanding (e.g., ICML 8 → ICLR 9):
- Add ablation studies reviewers requested
- Expand limitations discussion
- Include additional baselines
- Add qualitative examples

**Step 4: Conference-Specific Adjustments (ML/AI Venues)**

| Target Venue | Required Additions |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **ICML** | Broader Impact Statement (after conclusion) |
| **ICLR** | LLM usage disclosure, reciprocal reviewing agreement |
| **ACL/EMNLP** | Limitations section (mandatory), Ethics Statement |
| **AAAI** | Strict adherence to style file (no modifications) |
| **NeurIPS** | Paper checklist (appendix), lay summary if accepted |

**Systems Venues** (OSDI, NSDI, ASPLOS, SOSP): See the
[systems-paper-writing](../../systems-paper-writing/) skill.

**Step 5: Update References**

```latex
% Remove self-citations that reveal identity (for blind review)
% Update any "under review" citations to published versions
% Add new relevant work published since last submission
```

**Step 6: Addressing Previous Reviews**

When resubmitting after rejection:
- **Do** address reviewer concerns in the new version
- **Do** add experiments/clarifications reviewers requested
- **Don't** include a "changes from previous submission" section (blind review)
- **Don't** reference the previous submission or reviews

**Common Conversion Pitfalls:**
- ❌ Copying `\usepackage` commands (causes conflicts)
- ❌ Keeping old conference header/footer commands
- ❌ Forgetting to update `\bibliography{}` path
- ❌ Missing conference-specific required sections
- ❌ Exceeding page limit after format change
